	 * =================  Inheritance ============================
	 * # code re-usability
	 * # IS-A relationship
	 * # Generalization to specialization process
	 * # process of accessing parent class properties and methods into child class
	 * # There must be 2 classes of same domain
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Syntax:
	 *  class child_class_name  extends parent_class_name{
	 *  
	 *     //parent class properties and method
	 *     // child class properties and method 
	 *  }
	 * 
	 * e.g.
	 *   class A{
	 *   
	 *   }
	 *   class D{
	 *   
	 *   }
	 *   
	 *   //inheritance
	 *   class B extends A{
	 *   
	 *   }
	 *   
	 *   class B extends D{
	 *   
	 *   }
	 *   
	 *   # we can inherit only  one class at a time
